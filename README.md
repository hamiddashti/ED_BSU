
# Ecosystem Demography Model to Characterize Dryland's Carbon Cycle

**Welcome!**

This repository contains code for:

- Parameterizing the [Ecosystem Demography](https://github.com/EDmodel/ED2) model for shrublands in Idaho.
- Calibrating the model using the [PEST](https://pesthomepage.org/) parameter optimization framework.
- The model was then tested using field observations and satellite data.
- The pre- and post-processing scripts are in R and Python, while the model itself is written in Fortran.
- Analyses were primarily conducted on the Boise State University Cluster.

## Abstract

Dryland ecosystems are crucial to the global carbon cycle, contributing significantly to the regulation of the global carbon sink annually. Dynamic global vegetation models (DGVMs) are essential for understanding carbon cycling; however, their effectiveness in drylands is limited due to complex vegetation patterns and variable weather conditions. This study assesses the Ecosystem Demography (EDv2.2) DGVM's performance in a dryland region of Idaho, with a focus on gross primary production (GPP) from the years 2000 to 2017. The model was validated against eddy covariance data spanning 2015 to 2017 and remote sensing data from 2000 to 2017. Results show that EDv2.2 reliably simulates daily GPP at lower elevations and accurately reflects long-term trends. However, its performance diminishes at higher elevations with denser vegetation. Future studies aiming to enhance model accuracy should include a broader range of plant functional types endemic to drylands and improve the representation of plant processes.
